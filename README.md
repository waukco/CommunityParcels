Update Community Parcels

The Community Parcel solution will leverage the core ArcGIS Platform to help communities aggregate parcel information from authoritative sources in a simple and sustainable way and leverage this information in many workflows. 

This GitHub repository houses the data aggregation toolset used to update the community parcels (seamless set of parcels) feature service.  

Toolset features:

1. Map (fields) and adjust (project) your parcels to the community parcels schema
2. Truncate parcels from the community parcels ArcGIS online feature service using county code information (county description)
3. Add or update the community parcels ArcGIS online feature service 

Toolset tools:

1. Schema-only layer package that includes the Community Parcels schema
2. A toolbox to run the parcel aggregation from ArcGIS - ArcMap, with a simple tool to execute
3. A python scrpit that can run standalone as a Windows task scheduler, or any scheduler that can run a python script
4. A configuration file (text) that allows you to specify the location of your parcels, the community parcels, and username and password information
